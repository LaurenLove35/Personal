Self-improvement is an integration problem. 

We all want to improve our lives, and we read books and go to seminars to learn how to do so. But how often do we actually integrate the things we learn into our daily routines? 

This project takes the approach of [Algorithmic Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/algorithmic-learning/), which maintains and updates actual methodologies for doing things efficiently and then updates them as new information is acquired.

You should benefit from what you read, what you study, and what you learn. And the way to do that is to use that knoweldge to modify your actual behavior.

- Read a great article on diet? Adjust your daily diet accordingly.
- Saw a documentary on how pullups are a brilliant exercise? Change your daily exercise routine to incorporate them.
- Heard a cool new technique for testing web applications? Add it to your web testing methodology.

Don't let new knowledge seep through you and return to the ground. If you're serious about improvement, convert that knowledge into behavior.
