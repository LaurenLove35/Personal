Personal
========

This project tracks my personal goals, methodologies, routines, and interests over time.

It resides in Github because Git (and source code management systems in general) excel at when and why changes were made, which is precisely what is desired here.

I'm tracking the following types of things:

- Goals I wish to achieve 
- Methodologies and routines for doing things
- Preferences and favorites

## Methodologies and routines

For the methodologies and routine-oriented items, a single idea serves as a guide:

> Self-improvement is an integration problem. 

We all want to improve our lives, and we read books and go to seminars to learn how to do so. But how often do we actually integrate the things we learn into our daily routines? 

I call this approach [Algorithmic Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/algorithmic-learning/), which maintains and updates actual methodologies for doing things efficiently and then updates them as new information is acquired.

You should benefit from what you read, what you study, and what you learn. And the way to do that is to use that knoweldge to modify your actual behavior.

- Read a great article on diet? Adjust your daily diet accordingly.
- Saw a documentary on how pullups are a brilliant exercise? Change your daily exercise routine to incorporate them.
- Heard a cool new technique for testing web applications? Add it to your web testing methodology.

Don't let new knowledge seep through you and return to the ground. If you're serious about improvement, convert that knowledge into behavior. 

## Preferences and favorites

For preferences and favorites, I simply want to capture. Few things give people an understanding of who you are with the fidelity of exchanging music collections, or favorite books, or favorite movies.

So I keep these things here for that purpose.

## Tracking changes

As mentioned above, all changes to these items are tracked over time using the built-in functionality of Git. This lets you both keep them up to date, but even more importantly, show how your preferences change over time.

## Ideas

If you are doing something similar, or know of someone who is, send them my way. I love hearing what people are doing, and possible new ideas of things to track.
