# My Daily Routine

This routine is for all weekdays&mdash;Monday through Friday. If I miss a day I have not failed at anything or let anyone down. I simply pick back up the next day. It is a daily routine.

## Morning (at least three times per week)

1. (paused until TM class) Five ten mediation using the Headspace application
2. (paused until TM class) Two minutes of affirmations (from notes)
3. One set of pushups (to a lack of comfort or exhaustion)
4. One set of kettlebell swings (to a lack of comfort or exhaustion)
5. 500 meters on the rowing machine

[ NOTE: This should be combined with walks and table tennis 2-3 times per week, and general activity is being tracked through Apple Watch. ]

## Diet

- (currently doing diet soda) No soda (regular or diet)
- Avoid high-fructose corn syrup
- Avoid super sweet foods and sauces, especially in large quantities
- Eat slower
- Eat smaller portions

## Bedtime

- (currently not doing this; waiting on TM?) Two minutes of affirmations

## Sleep

- At least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep five days a week
- Nap at lunch or in the afternoon for 30 minutes, as needed
