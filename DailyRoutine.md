This is my constantly evolving daily routine.

I keep it updated in the spirit of the following post: [Algorithmic Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/two-ways-benefit-learning/). The basic idea is that instead of just randomly taking in content about how to improve your life, you should have an existing algorithm for doing the things you care about, and then explicitly update that algorithm when you read a book, or attend a conference, etc. 

And Git(hub) is a stellar way to manage such methodologies.

So here is one, for my daily routine.

## My Daily Routine

This routine is for all weekdays&mdash;Monday through Friday. If I miss a day I have not failed at anything or let anyone down. I simply pick back up the next day. It is a daily routine.

### Morning

1. Five minute mediation using the Headspace mobile app
2. One set of pushups (to exhaustion)
3. 500 meters on my rower

### Diet

- No soda (regular or diet)
- Avoid high-fructose corn syrup
- Avoid super sweet foods and sauces, especially in large quantities
- Eat slower
- Eat smaller portions

## Sleep

- At least eight hours of uninerrupted sleep five days a week
- Nap at lunch or in the afternoon for 30 minutes, as needed
