# My Daily Routine

This routine is for all weekdays&mdash;Monday through Friday. If I miss a day I have not failed at anything or let anyone down. I simply pick back up the next day. It is a daily routine.

## Morning

1. Five minute mediation using the Headspace mobile app
2. One set of pushups (to exhaustion)
3. 500 meters on my rower

## Diet

- No soda (regular or diet)
- Avoid high-fructose corn syrup
- Avoid super sweet foods and sauces, especially in large quantities
- Eat slower
- Eat smaller portions

## Sleep

- At least eight hours of uninerrupted sleep five days a week
- Nap at lunch or in the afternoon for 30 minutes, as needed
