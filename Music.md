## Music Types

I like three main types of music:

1. Metal
2. EDM
3. Post-metal

The band that most captures my taste in metal is Behemoth. The band that most captures my interest in EDM is Hardwell. The band that most captures my interest in post-metal is Isis.

## All-time favorites

My all-time favorite group is Tool.

## Best metal bands

1. Metallica
2. Slayer
3. Hard to sayâ€¦

Slayer is the group that showed me metal, so I have an affinity for them  like no other. But Metallica's Master of Puppets album is simply the best metal album of all time.
